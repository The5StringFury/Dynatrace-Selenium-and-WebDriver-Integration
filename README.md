[Selenium](http://seleniumhq.org/) is a free Web Application Testing System which has gained a lot of popularity since it became available. Its integration into FireFox - which allows instant
record/replay as well as the scripting option - makes it a great tool for functional web testing.  
[BrowserMob](http://browsermob.com/) on the other side leverages Selenium by providing an automated load-testing environment for Selenium scripts all configurable online via a Web Dashboard.  
Selenium also offers writing the test scripts as JUnit tests. With a special dynaTrace JUnit Runner and an extension to the Selenium base functionality it is now possible to tag web requests that are
executed by a Selenium Java Test.
